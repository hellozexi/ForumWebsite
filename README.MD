## pipenv

The python environment dependencies are managed by [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can install it by running
```bash
brew install pipenv
```

And configure the interpreter as pipenv in pycharm or run the server by using
```bash
pipenv run python main.py
```
To render the front-end pages
```bash
cd /frontend
npm install
npm run build
```
